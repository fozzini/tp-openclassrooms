Development and Distribution
A typical operating system consists of hundreds of different applications. In a proprietary operating system, the producer/seller of that operating system typically owns and manages the development of all that software. However open-source systems are usually created by obtaining and integrating applications invented and maintained by many independent groups - or even single independent developers. In addition, an open-source software project is often used in a variety of different operating systems - eg Linux-based, BSD-based, Hurd, and sometimes even integrated into proprietary operating systems such as Solaris, Mac, even Windows (if the licence allows).

The original software developers are sometimes referred to by distribution maintainers and end-users as the upstream source or simply upstream. Similarly, the developers often refer to the distributions that use their code, or the end-users as downstream.

Most open-source projects store their source code in a version-control system which is accessible over the internet (read-only for anonymous users). For such projects it is possible to download the very latest “in-progress” files, or to download the set of files “tagged” with some release-id (version number). However it is often not very efficient to do this; projects usually make regular releases by creating an archive file containing all the relevant files and make it available for download. For projects that do not have a public version-control system, such periodically released archive files are the only way to obtain the sourcecode directly.
